This is the source code/files for the ehcache.org website. The files in this repository are source files, some of which
include templating and other raw bits that need to be "compiled"/"built" in order to have files that are suitable to go
onto a webserver.

## Instructions for building/previewing

### Contributing

* Clone this repository to your local system (if you're going to contribute content, fork it first, and clone that)
* Create a branch to contribute content - `git checkout -b the_branch_for_the_pull_request`

### Mac

On Mac OS X, install Xcode command line tools by executing: `xcode-select --install`

### Ruby

Ruby versions are not as nicely backward compatible as Java. We recommend to use something like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) 
that will allow you to select a specific Ruby version. We also recommend to run jekyll through [bundler](http://bundler.io/) to insure  
the right jekyll version will be used.

* Install rbenv, ruby-build and rbenv-gemset - `brew install rbenv ruby-build rbenv-gemset` (on OS X)
* Configure it - `rbenv init` and follow the instructions
* Install Ruby - `rbenv install` (the version is specified in `.ruby-version`) 
* Install bundler - `gem install bundler`
* Install dependencies - `bundle install` (the will be installed in the `.gems` directory as configured in `.rbenv-gemsets`

### Linking with Ehcache 3 repository

To generate the *full* site including Ehcache 3 docs, you need to link some Ehcache 3 directories in this repository.

You should do it for every version you want to work on.

```bash
pushd ${ehcache3_root_directory}
git worktree add ${ehcache.org_root_directory}/${version_dir} ${branch}
popd
ln -s $PWD/${version_dir}/docs/src/docs/asciidoc/user documentation/${version}
```

| version | version_dir | branch      |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 3.0     | \_eh3       | release/3.0 |
| 3.1     | \_eh31      | release/3.1 |
| 3.2     | \_eh32      | release/3.2 |
| 3.3     | \_eh33      | release/3.3 |
| 3.4     | \_eh34      | release/3.4 |
| 3.5     | \_eh35      | release/3.5 |
| 3.6     | \_eh36      | release/3.6 |
| 3.7     | \_eh37      | release/3.7 |
| 3.8     | \_eh38      | release/3.8 |
| 3.9     | \_eh39      | release/3.9 |
| 3.10    | \_eh310     | release/3.10|
| 3.11    | \_eh311     | master      |

Of course, if for some reason you want a specific tag for a version, just create a worktree based on the tag instead.

### Linking with Terracotta events repository

The content of the [events menu](http://www.ehcache.org/events/) is coming from another repository. To see it in local,
just clone the repository and add a link to it.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Terracotta-OSS/terracotta.org-site-events.git
ln -s $PWD/terracotta.org-site-events ${ehcache.org_root_directory}/events
```

### Jekyll

The website is rendered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is built locally and the result is pushed to the
[website repository](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache.github.io).

To generate and view (locally serve) the site `bundle exec jekyll serve` then point your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

To simply generate the site use `bundle exec jekyll build`.

To generate the site including all production elements (ie analytics) `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build`  

**NOTE:** If you used links to include Ehcache 3 documentation, you may see an error about watching the same folder twice - it can be ignored.

### Html-proofer

Html-proofer is used to validate the content of the website. After building the site with jekyll you can run [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) 
through `./run_proofer.sh`.

See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache.org-site) if you are interested in improving the site in general.

### Making Changes to the content

If you want to make changes to the website, make them here (in this repository) - as this is where all the source/files for the website are kept.

For instance:

* If there is a new release being made, generated javadoc (from the product build) should be put into the `apidocs` directory
* New official docs should be put into the `documentation` and/or `generated` directories as appropriate
* Pay attention to the content of the `_config.yml` file in the root of this repository as there are properties there that
control various things just as which exact version of javadoc to show for what (e.g. at the time of this writing we link
to `2.8.5` javadoc for all `2.8` documentation).
* After making your changes, commit them (remember to do your work in a branch) and create a pull request.

### Deploying changes to the live webserver

[ehcache.org](http://www.ehcache.org/) is served/hosted by github. The webserver does NOT serve the content from this
repository. It serves the exact content of [another repository](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache.github.io).

Once your pull request has been merged, the site is deployed automatically.

### Contributing a blog post

1. Ensure you first edit `_data/authors.yml` to add your information
2. Create a new ASCII Doc file under `_posts/blog`. The file should be named with the following format: `yyyy-MM-DD-title-in-lowercase.adoc`
3. Add a header in your file. Modify the fields according to your post, especially for the title, headline, tags, authors and date
   ```
   ---
   layout: post
   title: "Your blog post title"
   headline: "Your blo post headline"
   categories: blog
   hidden: false
   author: your_author_key
   tags: [ehcache, website]
   date: 2016-05-04T18:00:00-05:00
   modified:
   ---
   ```
4. Send your pull request :+1:

### Contributing an external resource

Same rules apply as above, except that you have to put your file into `_posts/resources` and add a header like this one:

```
---
title: "Ehcache 3: JSR-107 on steroids"
headline: "Ehcache 3: JSR-107 on steroids at Devoxx Morocco by Louis Jacomet"
categories: resources
date: 2015-11-18T00:00:00-00:00
---
```

__IMPORTANT:__ Your content MUST be short! Links, headline, title, that's all.
